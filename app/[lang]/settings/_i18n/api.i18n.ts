// СЛОВА ВКЛАДКИ API — ОТДЕЛЬНЫЙ СЛОВАРЬ, ПО ОБЩЕМУ СТАНДАРТУ (185-2).
//
// 🎯 ТРЕБОВАНИЕ ВЛАДЕЛЬЦА 2026-09-11, ДОСЛОВНО: «на одной странице не надо
// делать текст и на русском и на английском поддерживать стандарт
// мультиязычности чтобы мы в будущем могли эти страницы масштабировать до 82
// языков».
//
// 🪦 ОТМЕНЯЕТ ЕГО ЖЕ РЕШЕНИЕ ТОГО ЖЕ ДНЯ — «используем английский язык для
// любой версии» и «Postman должен быть описан на обоих языках». Обе половины
// прежнего решения сняты одной правкой: страница говорит на ОДНОМ языке — том,
// который человек выбрал, — и Postman в том числе.
//
// 🔒 КАК ЭТО ДОРАСТЁТ ДО 82 ЯЗЫКОВ: сюда добавляются ветки с теми же ключами,
// файлом от внешней модели — ровно так же, как у `lib/words.mjs` и у словаря
// страницы. Ни один компонент при этом не правится.
//
// 🔒 ОПИСАНИЯ МЕТОДОВ И ПАРАМЕТРОВ ЖИВУТ ЗДЕСЬ, А НЕ В ДОГОВОРЕ, И ЭТО НЕ
// ПРОТИВОРЕЧИТ ЗАКОНУ «ПОРОЖДАТЬ, А НЕ ПЕРЕЧИСЛЯТЬ». Порождается СПИСОК: какие
// методы есть, какие у них параметры, какие обязательны — всё это страница
// берёт из `contract.mjs` и переписать руками не может. Здесь лежат только
// ПЕРЕВОДЫ, ключами по именам из договора.
// 🛑 И РАСХОЖДЕНИЕ ЛОВИТСЯ ПРИБОРОМ, А НЕ ВНИМАТЕЛЬНОСТЬЮ: `scripts/probe/api-i18n.mjs`
// проверяет, что у каждого метода и каждого параметра договора есть слова в
// КАЖДОМ языке. Нет перевода — страница показывает текст договора и помечает
// его как непереведённый, а прибор краснеет.
